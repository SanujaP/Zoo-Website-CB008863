          less amount of resources for them to get medications. Though for us
          humans, we have a responsibility to protect ourselves and the animals
          from the disease.
        </p>
        <p>What could we do to save the world from the disease?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be higenic</li>
          <li>Always wash hands and sanitize yourself</li>
          <li>Wear a mask and gloves if neccessary</li>
          <li>Be cautious about the surrounding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By doing the above, we can make sure that we provide a safe place for
          us and the animals in the world as well.
